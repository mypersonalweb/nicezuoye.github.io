<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Here are some projects that I am developed in this semester and I hope you will like them.</h3>

<p>The first project is Markovian-tweets. Consume a text file with sentences and produce a tweet (< 145 characters) with the style of the input text. </p>

 <p>The first project is Command-Line Minesweeper. That needs us write a function which consumes three arguments width height number_of_mines and generates a Minesweeper board internally. The board is a rectangle with a cover over each square. It will display this board to the user and prompt for a coordinate where they predict that no mine exists (format: x-coord y-coord 0-indexed). If they struck a mine then they lose (let them know). Otherwise uncover the selected square. If there are no adjacent mines then it should be blank and you uncover all adjacent squares too (chain-react this for every blank square). Otherwise show the number of mines in the surrounding 8 squares. If at somepoint only mines are covered then the user wins and the game ends. </p>
<p>The first project is ,the toughest one ,Gee-Mail. Write a secure asynchronous (same-machine) message platform. Here is what is must do: When loaded prompt the user to sign-in or register. When a user registers get their username and password. When a user logs in ask for username and validate password. If login fails, choose your response. Once logged in, tell them the number of messages they have, list the users that have sent them a message. (You can limit this to one message from a given sender or add a timestamp or even a title to messages if you want a level 2.) Then ask if they want to read messages or write messages. When writing messages prompt them for the receipient username, the message, and a shared passphrase with that receipient. When they read a message let them select the message somehow, then prompt them for the shared passphrase with that receipient, then show a plaintext message. </p>

<p>We’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.</p>

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creating pages manually</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
